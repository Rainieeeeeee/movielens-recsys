# MovieLens Recommendation System (movielens-recsys)

A full-stack recommendation system project built with:
- **Python (backend models)** for recommendation algorithms
- **Spring Boot / Node.js (optional backend)** for serving APIs
- **JavaScript (frontend)** for UI and interaction
- **MySQL / Firebase** for data storage
- **Jupyter Notebook** for experimentation

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project implements a recommendation system using the **MovieLens dataset**, starting from baseline popularity models to more advanced collaborative filtering and deep learning methods.

The long-term goal is to build a full-stack application that:
1. Prepares and stores user-item interaction data  
2. Trains baseline and advanced recommender models  
3. Serves recommendations via API (Spring Boot / FastAPI)  
4. Displays personalized recommendations through a web frontend
